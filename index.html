        <p> What were Nike shoes originally made for?
            Image result for nike shoes definition
            The first Nike shoe was nicknamed the 'Moon Shoe' and was made in Bowerman's waffle iron. This waffle sole design came into fruition after Bill Bowerman was eating breakfast and wondering if the grooves in his waffle would work for additional traction when playing sports.</p>

        <p> After a few test runs of the waffle iron, the Waffle Trainer was eventually born and found almost immediate success due to its grippy and performance-driven design. This first prototype model was technically the first Nike shoe and sold at Sotheby's for almost $450,000.The first commercial Nike shoe was a variation of the 'Moon Shoe' with a more refined design. The shoe would go on to be called the Nike Waffle Racer and was first handed out to athletes at US track events.Although the Waffle Racer was well-designed and a minor success, it did not launch Nike to the same heights as adidas or Puma just yet. However, a new design did help put them on the right trajectory. </p>

        <p>The duo found success with a design originally called the 'Aztec'. The name had to be changed due to adidas having a similarly named sneaker, so to reference history and the fall of the Aztecs, the shoe became the Nike Cortez. The Cortez was a great success after being debuted in the Mexico Games due to its advanced design and technology and helped Nike on their way to become the sneaker giant we know today. The Cortez has a confusing past, as it was originally designed and produced by Onitsuka Co. before Knight and Bowerman decided to release their own version under the name Nike. When Onitsuka Co. found out about Nike selling the Cortez model, the issue escalated and ended in a court battle. The argument was settled in court, with the judge ruling that both brands could sell their own iteration of the Cortez under their name.</p>

            By 1976, Nike was ready to continue on with expansion and so they hired John Brown and Partners, a Seattle based advertising company to help with gaining further exposure. A year later, the agency created the first brand ad for Nike entitled "There is No Finish Line". Though the ad didn't contain any actual Nike shoes up close, it was seemingly a success and further helped propel the brand into the stratosphere. By 1980, Nike had attained a whopping 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market and then went public as a company later that year.

            Following the popularity of its sneakers, Nike decided to expand out into the clothing world in 1979 and made a range of athletic clothing and sportswear. One of its first pieces was the Windrunner, a lightweight jacket that quickly became a favourite both on the street and on the track due to its modern chevron style design.
